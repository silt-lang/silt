The Outer Core library implements A Graph-based Intermediate Representation
loosely based on [Thorin, by Lei√üa, et. al.](http://compilers.cs.uni-saarland.de/papers/lkh15_cgo.pdf)

We extend Thorin's base model to support dependent types through aggressive
runtime type metadata to facilitate fast cross-module polymorphic dispatch.
